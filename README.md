# Car-black-box
The project aimed to create a black box system for cars that logs critical activities like gear shifts and speed. This system provides password-protected access for transport managers to view or download logs onto a PC. Its primary focus is on monitoring vehicle usage, handling, and efficiency, and taking action against rash driving behaviors.
